# Type 2 Diabetes Management Protocol
## Primary Care Clinical Guidelines

### 1. Initial Assessment

When a patient presents with suspected Type 2 Diabetes, the following assessments should be completed within the first consultation:

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) on two separate occasions
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L on two separate occasions
- Random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L with symptoms

**Initial Blood Tests:**
- HbA1c (baseline for monitoring)
- Fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides)
- Renal function (eGFR, ACR)
- Liver function tests
- Thyroid function (TSH)

**Physical Examination:**
- Blood pressure (target < 140/80 mmHg, or < 130/80 if kidney disease present)
- BMI and waist circumference
- Foot examination (pulses, sensation, skin integrity)
- Eye screening referral within 3 months of diagnosis

### 2. Lifestyle Interventions

All patients should receive structured education about:

**Dietary Advice:**
- Reduce total calorie intake if overweight (target 5-10% weight loss)
- Limit refined carbohydrates and sugary drinks
- Increase fibre intake (vegetables, legumes, whole grains)
- Mediterranean-style diet has strongest evidence base
- Refer to dietitian for personalised meal planning

**Physical Activity:**
- Minimum 150 minutes moderate-intensity activity per week
- Include resistance training 2-3 times per week
- Reduce sedentary time; break up prolonged sitting
- Tailor recommendations to patient's mobility and comorbidities

**Smoking Cessation:**
- Offer smoking cessation support at every contact
- Refer to NHS Stop Smoking Service
- Consider varenicline or NRT as appropriate

### 3. Pharmacological Management

**First-Line Therapy:**
Metformin remains first-line pharmacological treatment:
- Start 500mg once daily with food
- Titrate gradually over 2-4 weeks to minimise GI side effects
- Target dose: 1g twice daily (or maximum tolerated)
- Modified-release formulation if GI intolerance persists
- Contraindicated if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m²

**Second-Line Options (if HbA1c target not met after 3 months):**
Consider adding one of the following based on patient characteristics:

| Drug Class | Consider If | Avoid If |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| SGLT2 inhibitor | Heart failure, CKD, high CV risk | Recurrent UTIs, DKA risk |
| GLP-1 agonist | Obesity (BMI > 35), high CV risk | Pancreatitis history |
| DPP-4 inhibitor | Elderly, renal impairment | Heart failure (saxagliptin) |
| Sulfonylurea | Cost consideration, rapid response needed | Hypoglycaemia risk, weight gain concern |
| Pioglitazone | NAFLD, insulin resistance | Heart failure, bladder cancer history |

**SGLT2 Inhibitors - Additional Benefits:**
- Cardiovascular protection (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)
- Renal protection independent of glucose control
- Heart failure hospitalisation reduction
- Modest weight loss (2-3 kg typical)

**Warning Signs Requiring Urgent Review:**
- Symptoms of DKA (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion) - can occur even with normal glucose in SGLT2 users
- Fournier's gangrene (rare but serious) - perineal pain, tenderness, erythema
- Severe hypoglycaemia if on sulfonylureas

### 4. Monitoring Schedule

**Every 3 months (until stable):**
- HbA1c measurement
- Review of home glucose monitoring (if applicable)
- Medication tolerance and adherence
- Hypoglycaemia frequency

**Every 6 months (when stable):**
- HbA1c measurement
- Blood pressure
- Weight and BMI
- Foot check

**Annually:**
- Full lipid profile
- Renal function (eGFR, ACR)
- Eye screening (retinal photography)
- Comprehensive foot examination
- Review of cardiovascular risk (QRISK3)
- Depression screening (PHQ-2 minimum)
- Sexual health discussion
- Immunisation review (flu, pneumococcal)

### 5. Target Goals

| Parameter | Standard Target | Intensive Target (if safe) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| HbA1c | ≤ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) | ≤ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) |
| Blood Pressure | < 140/80 mmHg | < 130/80 mmHg |
| LDL Cholesterol | < 2.0 mmol/L | < 1.4 mmol/L (if very high CV risk) |

**Individualise targets based on:**
- Age and life expectancy
- Duration of diabetes
- Hypoglycaemia risk and awareness
- Comorbidities and frailty
- Patient preferences

### 6. When to Refer to Specialist

**Urgent Referral (same day):**
- Suspected DKA or HHS
- Foot ulcer with signs of infection
- Sudden vision loss

**Routine Referral to Diabetes Specialist:**
- HbA1c persistently > 75 mmol/mol despite dual therapy
- Complex insulin initiation required
- Recurrent hypoglycaemia
- Pregnancy planning (pre-conception counselling)
- Significant renal impairment (eGFR < 30)

**Multidisciplinary Team Referrals:**
- Dietitian: All newly diagnosed, weight management
- Podiatry: High-risk feet, neuropathy, PAD
- Psychology: Diabetes distress, needle phobia
- Retinal screening: Within 3 months of diagnosis, then annually

### 7. Patient Communication

**Key Messages for Patients:**
1. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition but can be well-managed
2. Lifestyle changes are as important as medication
3. Regular monitoring helps catch problems early
4. Know the warning signs of high and low blood sugar
5. Attend all screening appointments (eyes, feet, kidneys)

**Self-Management Support:**
- Provide access to structured education (DESMOND, X-PERT)
- Ensure patient has clear sick day rules
- Discuss driving regulations if applicable
- Signpost to Diabetes UK resources
